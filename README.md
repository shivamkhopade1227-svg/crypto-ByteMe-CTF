The Dragon's Handshake

House Targaryen uses a powerful cryptographic ritual to secure messages between Dragonstone and the Iron Throne.

The ravens carrying the exchange were intercepted.
The handshake was fully observed.
Yet the scroll remains sealed.

Those who study the ritual will notice that not all seals are part of the message itself.
True maesters know where a dragon leaves its mark.

Study the handshake.
Restore the ritual.
Unseal the message.
